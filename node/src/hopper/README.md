# `hopper`
Micro routing for PulseCloak Network traffic

## Purpose
The purpose of `hopper` is to interpret CORES packages, determining their next destination --
either inside the current PulseCloak Node (i.e. to the `ProxyServer` or the `ProxyClient`)
or on to the next Node in its Route.

It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/PulseCloak-Project/Node/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.

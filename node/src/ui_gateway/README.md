# `ui_gateway`

## Purpose
The purpose of `ui_gateway` is to provide a WebSockets server to which user-interface elements can 
connect, and a sink for commands and source for status data from and to such elements.

### Further Documentation
The UI-Interface Interface Documentation outlines all the current PulseCloakNode-UIv2 messaging available across Websockets.
